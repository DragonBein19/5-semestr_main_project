I am a motivated and ambitious student at Vilnius College,
continuously learning new skills and improving my existing
ones. I am passionate about programming and actively
developing my technical knowledge through study and practice.
Although I donâ€™t yet have professional work experience,
I am eager to start my career as a programmer and apply my
skills in real-world projects.
